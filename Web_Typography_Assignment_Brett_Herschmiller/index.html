    <h1>World at war</h1>

    <div class="World_at_War_Flex">
        <p>The War of the Worlds is a science fiction novel by English author H. G. Wells, first serialised in 1897 by
            Pearson's Magazine in the UK and by Cosmopolitan magazine in the US. The novel's first appearance in
            hardcover was in 1898 from publisher William Heinemann of London. Written between 1895 and 1897, it is one
            of the earliest stories to detail a conflict between mankind and an extra-terrestrial race. The novel is the
            first-person narrative of both an unnamed protagonist in Surrey and of his younger brother in London as
            southern England is invaded by Martians. The novel is one of the most commented-on works in the science
            fiction canon.</p>

        <p>The plot has been related to invasion literature of the time. The novel has been variously interpreted as a
            commentary on evolutionary theory, British imperialism, and generally Victorian superstitions, fears, and
            prejudices. Wells said that the plot arose from a discussion with his brother Frank about the catastrophic
            effect of the British on indigenous Tasmanians. What would happen, he wondered, if Martians did to Britain
            what the British had done to the Tasmanians? At the time of publication, it was classified as a scientific
            romance, like Wells's earlier novel The Time Machine.</p>

        <p>The War of the Worlds has been both popular (having never been out of print) and influential, spawning half a
            dozen feature films, radio dramas, a record album, various comic book adaptations, a number of television
            series, and sequels or parallel stories by other authors. It was most memorably dramatised in a 1938 radio
            programme directed by and starring Orson Welles that allegedly caused public panic among listeners who did
            not know the Martian invasion was fictional. The novel has even influenced the work of scientists, notably
            Robert H. Goddard, who, inspired by the book, helped develop both the liquid-fuelled rocket and multistage
            rocket, which resulted in the Apollo 11 Moon landing 71 years later.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>The Coming of the Martians </h2>

    <div class="The_Coming_of_the_Martians_Flex">
        <p>The narrative opens by stating that as humans on Earth busied themselves with their own endeavours during the
            mid-1890s, aliens on Mars began plotting an invasion of Earth because their own resources are dwindling. The
            Narrator (who is unnamed throughout the novel) is invited to an astronomical observatory at Ottershaw where
            explosions are seen on the surface of the planet Mars, creating much interest in the scientific community.
            Months later, a so-called &quot;meteor&quot; lands on Horsell Common, near the Narrator's home in Woking,
            Surrey. He is among the first to discover that the object is an artificial cylinder that opens, disgorging
            Martians who are &quot;big&quot; and &quot;greyish&quot; with &quot;oily brown skin&quot;, &quot;the size,
            perhaps, of a bear&quot;, each with &quot;two large dark-coloured eyes&quot;, and lipless &quot;V-shaped
            mouths&quot; which drip saliva and are surrounded by two &quot;Gorgon groups of tentacles&quot;. The
            Narrator finds them &quot;at once vital, intense, inhuman, crippled and monstrous&quot;. They emerge
            briefly, but have difficulty in coping with the Earth's atmosphere and gravity, and so retreat rapidly into
            their cylinder.</p>

        <p>A human deputation (which includes the astronomer Ogilvy) approaches the cylinder with a white flag, but the
            Martians incinerate them and others nearby with a heat-ray before beginning to assemble their machinery.
            Military forces arrive that night to surround the common, including Maxim guns. The population of Woking and
            the surrounding villages are reassured by the presence of the British Army. A tense day begins, with much
            anticipation by the Narrator of military action.</p>

        <p>After heavy firing from the common and damage to the town from the heat-ray which suddenly erupts in the late
            afternoon, the Narrator takes his wife to safety in nearby Leatherhead, where his cousin lives, using a
            rented, two-wheeled horse cart. He then returns to Woking to return the cart when in the early morning
            hours, a violent thunderstorm erupts. On the road during the height of the storm, he has his first
            terrifying sight of a fast-moving Martian fighting-machine; in a panic, he crashes the horse cart, barely
            escaping detection. He discovers the Martians have assembled towering three-legged
            &quot;fighting-machines&quot; (tripods), each armed with a heat-ray and a chemical weapon: the poisonous
            &quot;black smoke&quot;. These tripods have wiped out the army units positioned around the cylinder and
            attacked and destroyed most of Woking. Taking shelter in his house, the Narrator sees a fleeing artilleryman
            moving through his garden, who later tells the Narrator of his experiences and mentions that another
            cylinder has landed between Woking and Leatherhead, which means the Narrator is now cut off from his wife.
            The two try to escape via Byfleet just after dawn, but are separated at the Shepperton to Weybridge Ferry
            during a Martian afternoon attack on Shepperton.</p>

        <p>One of the Martian fighting-machines is brought down in the River Thames by artillery as the Narrator and
            countless others try to cross the river into Middlesex, and the Martians retreat to their original crater.
            This gives the authorities precious hours to form a defence-line covering London. After the Martians'
            temporary repulse, the Narrator is able to float down the Thames in a boat toward London, stopping at
            Walton, where he first encounters the curate, his companion for the coming weeks.</p>

        <p>Towards dusk, the Martians renew their offensive, breaking through the defence-line of siege guns and field
            artillery centred on Richmond Hill and Kingston Hill by a widespread bombardment of the black smoke; an
            exodus of the population of London begins. This includes the Narrator's younger brother, a medical student
            (also unnamed), who flees to the Essex coast, after the sudden, panicked, pre-dawn order to evacuate London
            is given by the authorities, on a terrifying and harrowing journey of three days, amongst thousands of
            similar refugees streaming from London. The brother encounters Mrs. Elphinstone and her younger
            sister-in-law, just in time to help them fend off three men who are trying to rob them. Since Mrs.
            Elphinstone's husband is missing, the three continue on together.</p>

        <p>After a terrifying struggle to cross a streaming mass of refugees on the road at Barnet, they head eastward.
            Two days later, at Chelmsford, their pony is confiscated for food by the local Committee of Public Supply.
            They press on to Tillingham and the sea. There, they manage to buy passage to Continental Europe on a small
            paddle steamer, part of a vast throng of shipping gathered off the Essex coast to evacuate refugees. The
            torpedo ram HMS Thunder Child destroys two attacking tripods before being destroyed by the Martians,
            although this allows the evacuation fleet to escape, including the ship carrying the Narrator's brother and
            his two travelling companions. Shortly thereafter, all organised resistance has collapsed, and the Martians
            roam the shattered landscape unhindered.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>The Earth under the Martians </h2>

    <div class="The_Earth_Under_the_Martians">
    <p>At the beginning of Book Two, the Narrator and the curate are plundering houses in search of food. During this
        excursion, the men witness a Martian handling-machine enter Kew, seizing any person it finds and tossing them
        into a &quot;great metallic carrier which projected behind him, much as a workman's basket hangs over his
        shoulder&quot;, and the Narrator realises that the Martian invaders may have &quot;a purpose other than
        destruction&quot; for their victims. At a house in Sheen, &quot;a blinding glare of green light&quot; and a loud
        concussion attend the arrival of the fifth Martian cylinder,and both men are trapped beneath the ruins for two
        weeks.</p>

    <p>The Narrator's relations with the curate deteriorate over time, and eventually he knocks him unconscious to
        silence his now loud ranting; the curate is overheard outside by a Martian, which eventually removes his
        unconscious body with one of its handling machine tentacles. The reader is then led to believe the Martians will
        perform a fatal transfusion of the curate's blood to nourish themselves, as they have done with other captured
        victims viewed by the Narrator through a small slot in the house's ruins. The Narrator just barely escapes
        detection from the returned foraging tentacle by hiding in the adjacent coal-cellar.</p>

    <p>Eventually the Martians abandon the cylinder's crater, and the Narrator emerges from the collapsed house where he
        had observed the Martians up close during his ordeal; he then approaches West London. Enroute, he finds the
        Martian red weed everywhere, a prickly vegetation spreading wherever there is abundant water but slowly dying
        due to bacterial infection. On Putney Heath, once again he encounters the artilleryman, who persuades him of a
        grandiose plan to rebuild civilisation by living underground; after a few hours, the Narrator perceives the
        laziness of his companion and abandons him. Now in a deserted and silent London, slowly he begins to go mad from
        his accumulated trauma, finally attempting to end it all by openly approaching a stationary fighting-machine. To
        his surprise, he discovers that all the Martians have been killed by an onslaught of earthly pathogens, to which
        they had no immunity: &quot;slain, after all man's devices had failed, by the humblest things that God, in his
        wisdom, has put upon this earth&quot;.</p>

    <p>The Narrator continues on, finally suffering a brief but complete nervous breakdown, which affects him for days;
        he is nursed back to health by a kind family. Eventually, he is able to return by train to Woking via a
        patchwork of newly repaired tracks. At his home, he discovers that his beloved wife has, somewhat miraculously,
        survived. In the last chapter, the Narrator reflects on the significance of the Martian invasion, its impact on
        humanity's view of itself and the future, and the &quot;abiding sense of doubt and insecurity&quot; it has left
        in his mind.</p>

    <h3>Plot</h3>

    <p>No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly
        and closely by intelligences greater than man&rsquo;s and yet as mortal as his own... Yet across the gulf of
        space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and
        unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us.</p>

    <p>&mdash;&#8201;H. G. Wells (1898), The War of the Worlds</p>
</div>
<div class="style_div">
    <h3>Style</h3>

    <p>The War of the Worlds presents itself as a factual account of the Martian invasion. It is considered one of the
        first works to theorise the existence of a race intelligent enough to invade Earth. The Narrator is a
        middle-class writer of philosophical papers, somewhat reminiscent of Doctor Kemp in The Invisible Man, with
        characteristics similar to author Wells at the time of writing. The reader learns very little about the
        background of the Narrator or indeed of anyone else in the novel; characterisation is unimportant. In fact none
        of the principal characters are named, aside from the astronomer Ogilvy.</p>

    </div>
    
    <h3>Scientific setting</h3>
    <div class="scientific_setting_div">

    <p>Wells trained as a science teacher during the latter half of the 1880s. One of his teachers was Thomas Henry
        Huxley, famous as a major advocate of Darwinism. He later taught science, and his first book was a biology
        textbook. He joined the scientific journal Nature as a reviewer in 1894. Much of his work is notable for making
        contemporary ideas of science and technology easily understandable to readers.</p>

    <p>The scientific fascinations of the novel are established in the opening chapter where the Narrator views Mars
        through a telescope, and Wells offers the image of the superior Martians having observed human affairs, as
        though watching tiny organisms through a microscope. Ironically it is microscopic Earth lifeforms that finally
        prove deadly to the Martian invasion force. In 1894 a French astronomer observed a 'strange light' on Mars, and
        published his findings in the scientific journal Nature on the second of August that year. Wells used this
        observation to open the novel, imagining these lights to be the launching of the Martian cylinders toward Earth.
    </p>

    <p>American astronomer Percival Lowell published the book Mars in 1895 suggesting features of the planet's surface
        observed through telescopes might be canals. He speculated that these might be irrigation channels constructed
        by a sentient life form to support existence on an arid, dying world, similar to that which Wells suggests the
        Martians have left behind. The novel also presents ideas related to Charles Darwin's theory of natural
        selection, both in specific ideas discussed by the Narrator, and themes explored by the story.</p>

    <p>Wells also wrote an essay titled 'Intelligence on Mars', published in 1896 in the Saturday Review, which sets out
        many of the ideas for the Martians and their planet that are used almost unchanged in The War of the Worlds.[11]
        In the essay he speculates about the nature of the Martian inhabitants and how their evolutionary progress might
        compare to humans. He also suggests that Mars, being an older world than the Earth, might have become frozen and
        desolate, conditions that might encourage the Martians to find another planet on which to settle. Wells has also
        theorised how life could evolve in the conditions that are so hostile like those on Mars. The creatures have no
        digestive system, no appendages except tentacles and put the blood of other beings in their veins to survive.

    <h3>Physical location</h3>

    <h4>The Tripod in Woking</h4>
    <div class="flex">
    <div class="tripod_in_working_div">

    <p>In 1895, Wells was an established writer and he married his second wife, Catherine Robbins, moving with her to
        the town of Woking in Surrey. There, he spent his mornings walking or cycling in the surrounding countryside,
        and his afternoons writing. The original idea for The War of the Worlds came from his brother during one of
        these walks, pondering on what it might be like if alien beings were suddenly to descend on the scene and start
        attacking its inhabitants.</p>

    <p>Much of The War of the Worlds takes place around Woking and the surrounding area. The initial landing site of the
        Martian invasion force, Horsell Common, was an open area close to Wells' home. In the preface to the Atlantic
        edition of the novel, he wrote of his pleasure in riding a bicycle around the area, imagining the destruction of
        cottages and houses he saw by the Martian heat-ray or their red weed. While writing the novel, Wells enjoyed
        shocking his friends by revealing details of the story, and how it was bringing total destruction to parts of
        the South London landscape that were familiar to them. The characters of the artilleryman, the curate, and the
        brother medical student were also based on acquaintances in Woking and Surrey.</p>

    <p>Wells wrote in a letter to Elizabeth Healey about his choice of locations: &quot;I'm doing the dearest little
        serial for Pearson's new magazine, in which I completely wreck and sack Woking &ndash; killing my neighbours in
        painful and eccentric ways &ndash; then proceed via Kingston and Richmond to London, which I sack, selecting
        South Kensington for feats of peculiar atrocity.&quot;</p>

    <p>A 7-metre (23 feet) high sculpture of a tripod fighting machine, entitled The Martian, based on descriptions in
        the novel stands in Crown Passage close to the local railway station in Woking, designed and constructed by
        artist Michael Condron.</p>
    </div>
    <img src="img/martian_planet.webp" alt="A picture of a martian planet.">
</div>

    
    <div class="cultural_setting_div">
        <h4>Cultural setting</h4>

    <p>Wells' depiction of suburban late Victorian culture in the novel was an accurate representation of his own
        experiences at the time of writing. In the late 19th century, the British Empire was the predominant colonial
        and naval power on the globe, making its domestic heart a poignant and terrifying starting point for an invasion
        by Martians with their own imperialist agenda. He also drew upon a common fear which had emerged in the years
        approaching the turn of the century, known at the time as fin de si&egrave;cle or 'end of the age', which
        anticipated apocalypse at midnight on the last day of 1899.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Publication</h3>
    <div class="Publication_div">

    <p>In the late 1890s it was common for novels, prior to full volume publication, to be serialised in magazines or
        newspapers, with each part of the serialisation ending upon a cliffhanger to entice audiences to buy the next
        edition. This is a practice familiar from the first publication of Charles Dickens' novels earlier in the
        nineteenth century. The War of the Worlds was first published in serial form in Pearson's Magazine in April
        &ndash; December 1897.[24] Wells was paid &pound;200 and Pearsons demanded to know the ending of the piece
        before committing to publish.</p>

    <p>The complete volume was published by William Heinemann in 1898 and has been in print ever since.</p>

    <p>Two unauthorised serialisations of the novel were published in the United States prior to the publication of the
        novel. The first was published in the New York Evening Journal between December 1897 and January 1898. The story
        was published as Fighters from Mars or the War of the Worlds. It changed the location of the story to a New York
        setting. The second version changed the story to have the Martians landing in the area near and around Boston,
        and was published by the Boston Post in 1898, which Wells protested against. It was called Fighters from Mars,
        or the War of the Worlds in and near Boston.</p>

    <p>Both pirated versions of the story were followed by Edison's Conquest of Mars by Garrett P. Serviss. Even though
        these versions are deemed as unauthorised serialisations of the novel, it is possible that H. G. Wells may have,
        without realising it, agreed to the serialisation in the New York Evening Journal. Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston
        repressed the book in 2000, paired with The Time Machine, and commissioned Michael Koelsch to illustrate a new
        cover art.</p>
